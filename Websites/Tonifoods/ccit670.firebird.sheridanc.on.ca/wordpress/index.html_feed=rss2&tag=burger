								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap">I know I know, we&#8217;re not supposed to eat fast food anymore but I gave into peer pressure and needed to find what the fuss was about. So, I had Chic-fil-A on two different occasions. For the first time I had Chic-fil-A it was definitely worth the hype. The burgers were so tender and delicious, never tasted so much flavor in a fast food burger before. I was in a trance I kid you not, my friend &#8217;45&#8217; can testify. the chips or wedges rather were okay to be fair, nothing special. The chicken fingers were just there also, nothing to shout about. the milkshake was really good, I mean REALLY good. But then again you can never go wrong with a milk shake anyways. I would rate my first experience at chic fila a solid 9/10. I definitely recommend you have the burger. Remember, on your cheat day only!! Also, the location was Downtown Toronto. NOW, for my second experience oh brother. I mean we did not have to wait in line too long because we met a friend, chic-fil-a is notorious for their long lines. Anyways, the food was nowhere near what it was at the other location. I would give it a straight 6/10, maybe even a 5. The burger wasn&#8217;t just up to the task that day. </p>
