# Augeo
The project is currently called Augeo which is latin for enlarge/expand.
It allows users to create products which other users can then bid on.
The project is a long way from being complete but I'd say there is some basic functionality in it.
I do not intend to make this an actual platform/website rather I am using it as a learning experience and a place to hone my skills.

## Current Functionalities
The products have a duration which gives a sense of urgency to the whole thing.
Users can currently create an account as well as login, create a product, bid on products or outright buy them.
The products have a timeout function which works by assigning the product to the user with the highest bid when the duration expires.
Expired products or products that have been bought are not displayed to users in the homeand browse page.
Users can view their listings, bids and purchases in the account page.
All the products in a category are assumed to be new and of the same model and type. No discrenpancies are allowed.

## Future Functionalities
New categories can be added but they would need to be authorized first.
The platform is also going to work based on its own currency. Seeing as users need to be able to bid as soon as possible and getting them to fill in their bank information while trying to bid for a product that ends in 5 seconds is not very user friendly.
An address table will be added as well as an address form in the account page.
Ability to message between the seller and the buyer of the product.
